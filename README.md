# Real Estate

This project focuses on predicting housing prices using a machine learning model. The model leverages features such as the number of rooms, lower status of the population, and other relevant factors. The task at hand is a regression problem, and the model uses supervised learning techniques to make accurate predictions.

## Models used and Compared:
The project compares the performance of different regression models for housing price prediction:

1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Tree Regression
3. Random Forest Regression

Each model is evaluated and compared based on their ability to accurately predict housing prices.
